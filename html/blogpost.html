                    To provide context for my course evaluations, my interests
                    and background largely lie in information technology and
                    multimedia. My education and professional experiences have
                    focused on IT, web development, and graphic design. I have
                    also dabbled in live stream production and film studies.
                    These interests influence the

                </p>
                <p>
                    Another factor in my course selection is my preference for
                    certain types of assessments. I tend to avoid courses with
                    midterms or final exams. Instead, I prefer those that
                    feature final projects, programming tasks, weekly labs, and
                    individual work.

                    This is straightforward, with a focus on group work and

                    Attendance at tutorials is critical as they contribute
                    significantly to the final grade. The course involves essay
                    work which can be easily done with the posted slides. Also,
                    it luckily does not have a final examination. This course

                    a final exam. I aim to take it in Summer due to the 40%
                    weightage of the final exam during Fall and Winter.

                            and final examination. Personally, it was a bit
                            boring and attendance was not required.
